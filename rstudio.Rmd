# snippets

* Template below
* "$" will designate where the cursor should go next after hitting `TAB`
* "{1:varname}" will define the variables to be replaced
* Typically, these are strung together as follows: "${1:varname}"
* Every instanced of "$" that is not used in this manner must be escaped as
follows: "\$"

```
snippet sm
    setMethod("${1:gen}", ${2:"class"}, function(${3:obj}, ...) {
        ${0}
    })
```

# inline codeblocks

* When attempting to render text that would usually generate a codeblock using
`knitr`, it must be escaped with `n + 1`
